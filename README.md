# MDict Query R

This project is based on [mdict-query](https://github.com/mmjang/mdict-query), [mdict-analysis](https://bitbucket.org/xwang/mdict-analysis/src/master/), [writemdict](https://github.com/zhansliu/writemdict).

You can use this library to query MDX and MDD files. The library will create SQLite files to save dictionary indexes when you initiate a querier or add new dictionaries.

You can also use the original library to query and write MDX and MDD files.

# Install

```bash
pip install mdict_query_r
```

# Usage

```python
from mdict_query_r.query import Querier
```
